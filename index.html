			<p class="move_up">Patricia Nilsson</p>
			<p class="me">I'm a bit of Polish and a bit of Swedish, and I have lived and worked in Shanghai, Istanbul and London. I became a freelance journalist during my undergraduate studies at SOAS and went on to learn how to use data, video and a bit of code to tell better stories at Goldsmiths. Aside from my featured writing, I have worked with sustainability issues for the Swedish Trade Council, as a researcher on Turkish security policy at EDAM and as a speech programme producer at SOAS Radio.</p>
